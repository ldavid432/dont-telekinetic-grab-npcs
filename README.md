# Don't Telegrab NPCs

Prevents you from casting telekinetic grab on NPCs so you can pick up your drops in peace.

You can allow specific NPCs to be telegrabbed if you want by editing the whitelist, by default it contains the Maze Guardian from the mage training arena as well as all sailing monsters (since their corpses can be telegrabbed).
